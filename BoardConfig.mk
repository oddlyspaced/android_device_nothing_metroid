# Turning it off on 2026-07-29 surfaced six real duplicate-install bugs in this tree, all now
# fixed (see below). After those, the only remaining collision is inside AOSP itself —
# system_ext/etc/aconfig/flag.info, defined by both build/make/core/Makefile:146 and
# build/make/core/packaging/flags.mk:169 — which is not ours to fix, so the flag goes back on.
#
# Real bugs it had been hiding, all fixed:
#   1. stock fstab.default blob shadowed the device-tree copy -> vold saw no fileencryption and
#      FBE silently fell back to plaintext (ro.crypto.state=unsupported)
#   2. stock fstab.emmc blob, same pattern
#   3. our hand-made android.hardware.drm-service.clearkey.xml duplicated AOSP's own fragment
#   4. our mapper.qti.xml duplicated the one from hardware/qcom-caf/.../gralloc (this one had
#      already been "dropped" in a comment on 07-10 but the module was never actually removed)
#   5. our vendor.qti.qspa-service.xml duplicated core-utils-vendor's
#   6. libprotobuf-cpp-{full,lite}-21.12 and libclang_rt.ubsan_standalone shipped as blobs while
#      the platform builds the same sonames from source
#
# Periodically re-test by commenting this out and running a build; anything new it catches is a

# androidboot.init_fatal_reboot_target=recovery: REMOVED 2026-07-29. It was a bring-up aid (an init

# bootloops before being identified: in recovery mode a fatal init error reboots to recovery, which
# fails again, forever. It does this to ANY recovery image — a known-good OrangeFox build looped
# identically, which is what finally isolated it. Init's default target is "bootloader", so without

#
# The pin used to live here with a comment blaming an "NDK31->NDK36 AIDL ABI skew" in the
# android.hardware.*-V{N}-ndk.so libs. That diagnosis was WRONG; do not resurrect it:
#   - The from-source -ndk.so libs export a strict SUPERSET of the prebuilt ones. The only
#     absent symbol is __cfi_check (cross-DSO CFI is off here), which is not a load failure.
#   - Intersecting the UND symbols of 10 proprietary consumer HALs against the from-source
#     libs gave ZERO unresolved symbols in every case. The size delta is .text codegen.
#   - aidl_api frozen versions all match; nothing builds as an unfrozen V{N+1}.
#   - The "only the -ndk.so libs differ" diff was bogus: it silently skipped /vendor/bin
#     (permission denied without sudo).
# The actual regression was /vendor/bin/hw/audiohalservice.qti going missing because
# `PRODUCT_PACKAGES += audiohalservice.qti` got commented out in device.mk, while its .rc and
# the audio.core VINTF fragment still shipped -> audioserver dies -> system_server crash loop
# The pin masked the source-build dependency chain because the
# pinned image was a Jul 8 build made while that line was still live.
